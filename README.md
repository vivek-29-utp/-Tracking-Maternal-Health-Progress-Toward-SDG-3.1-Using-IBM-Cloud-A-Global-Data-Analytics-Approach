# 📊 Project 36: Tracking Maternal Health Progress Toward SDG 3.1 Using IBM Cloud

## 📌 Project Description
This project analyzes maternal health data to track global progress toward SDG 3.1 using IBM Cloud Lite services. It uses Python, Jupyter, and Prophet to clean, visualize, and forecast MMR trends based on indicators like antenatal care, skilled birth attendance, and healthcare access, highlighting regional disparities.

## 🎯 Problem Statement (from SB4Academia)
The Sustainable Development Goal 3.1 aims to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. Monitoring progress requires analyzing country-wise data on maternal mortality and associated health indicators such as antenatal care coverage, skilled birth attendance, adolescent birth rates, and healthcare expenditures.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- IBM Cloud Lite (Watson Studio, Object Storage)
- Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Prophet
- IBM Cognos Analytics (for dashboards)
